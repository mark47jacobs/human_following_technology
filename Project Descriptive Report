   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  This project was the intial prototype for the developement of human following technology XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   
   The initial prototype - the human following robot#1 is an ARDUINO MICROCONTROLLER PLATFORM based robot which involved the 
   use of an utrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor as the sensor assembly and used the L298N DUAL H-BRIDGE motor driver IC
   to control the two dc motors which enabled the robot to move linearly and also to change the direction of motion.
   
   ->The robot will be able to detect the nearest object and then align itself in the direction of the nearest object detected
   
   ->Nearest object detection: This will be made possible by the ultrasonic sensor+servo motor assembly. The ultrasonic sensor will 
     scan a range of 180degsending input of distance at every 5deg rotation and this will be stored in an array. Then the shortest 
     distance will be computed, the angle corresponding to it will be the angular position of nearest object .
     
   ->Aligining the robot : the angular position of the nearest object is stored in a register . Using this value the amount of time 
     for which the turning mechanism has to be supplied power is caluculated using the following formula..(coming very soon)
     
   ->Linearly following the nearest object: after aligining itself in the direction of the  nearest object it will follow it linearly.
     The best way to describe the following capabilities of the robot is as follows..
          "the robot will follow the object 'SYNCRONOUSLY' almost mirroring the speed of direction and motion only when the object
          remains in a particular distance range"
   
   ->Speed sync : This was the most difficult part to achieve . This is done by dynamically calculating the speed of the robot and then 
     achieving an equivalent speed for the robot(equivalent but in max speed limit for the robot)
     It was done using the following methodology.....(coming very soon)
